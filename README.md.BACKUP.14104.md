BloodSugarConverter
===================

An Apache Cordova based mobile app that converts blood glucose measurements to/from US and International units.

I developed this as a simple test app to try out the new Visual Studio Cordova tooling.

I'm new to HTML and Javascript so the code is probably a bit rubbish - any criticisms and comments greatfully received.

I'll be putting this app on the app store just to try out the whole process, and blogging about it on [my blog](http://jimbobbennett.io)

HelloWorldCordova
=================

Since the release of [Cordova tools for Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dn722381) I've decided to have a play to see what I can create.

I'll be blogging about the process on my [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blog:
