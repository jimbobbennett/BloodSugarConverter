BloodSugarConverter
===================

A Apache Cordova based mobile app that converts blood glucose measurements to/from US and International units.

I developed this as a simple test app to try out the new Visual Studio Cordova tooling.

I'm new to HTML and Javascript so the code is probably a bit rubbish - any criticisms and comments greatfully received.

I'll be putting this app on the app store just to try out the whole process, and blogging about it on [my blog](http://jimbobbennett.io)
